            <p>
              When Robin Antin and <strong>Kenny Wormald</strong> (star of
              Footloose and world-renowned choreographer) opened Playground LA
              in February 2017, they had a clear vision: to create a space where
              dancers could truly play, experiment, and push the boundaries of
              their craft.
            </p>

            <p>
              Located on the famous <strong>Melrose Avenue</strong> in Los Angeles,
              the studio quickly became known for its high-energy atmosphere,
              industry-leading instructors, and commitment to developing the next
              generation of dance talent.
            </p>

            <p>
              Playground LA offers master classes, daily dance sessions, and dance
              fitness programs taught by some of the most sought-after
              choreographers in the industry. Classes regularly accommodate up to
              100 dancers and consistently sell out, attracting students from
              around the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              The studio has become a premiere destination for artists to recruit
              dancers for music videos, tours, and live performances. Major stars
              like <strong>Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, and Paris Hilton</strong>{' '}
              have held auditions at Playground LA, recognizing it as the place
              to find the industry's best talent.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2024, the studio's culture and impact were showcased in the Hulu
              reality series <strong>"Playground"</strong>, executive produced by
              Megan Thee Stallion, giving audiences an inside look at the talent,
              dedication, and creativity that defines Playground LA.

            <p>
              Playground LA has become more than just a dance studioâ€”it's a
              cultural institution where careers are launched, artistry is
              refined, and the future of dance is shaped.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the expansion to Playground London in 2023, Robin and Kenny's
              vision continues to grow, creating a global community of dancers
              who share a passion for excellence, creativity, and pushing
              boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              The studio remains committed to its founding mission: providing a
              space where dancers of all levels can come together, learn from
              the best, and discover what's possible when talent meets
              opportunity.
